# Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

## Project Overview
Predicting customer churn is critical for telecom companies to retain their customers and remain competitive. This project leverages machine learning models to analyze customer behavior and predict whether a customer is likely to churn.

---

## Objectives
- Analyze and understand factors influencing customer churn.
- Develop a predictive model to classify customers as churners or non-churners.
- Provide actionable insights to reduce churn rates.

---

## Dataset
The dataset contains customer information such as:
- Demographic details
- Subscription plans
- Usage statistics
- Customer support interactions
- Payment and billing information

### Key Columns
- **CustomerID**: Unique customer identifier
- **Tenure**: Number of months the customer has been with the company
- **Contract Type**: Monthly, yearly, etc.
- **Churn**: Target variable (Yes/No)

---

## Data Preprocessing Steps
1. Handle missing values.
2. Encode categorical variables.
3. Normalize numerical features.
4. Address data imbalances.

---

## Model Development
- **Algorithms Tested:**
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting Classifiers

- **Evaluation Metrics:**
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1 Score
  - ROC-AUC

---

## Results and Insights
- The Random Forest model achieved the highest accuracy of 92%.
- Top factors contributing to churn include contract type, customer tenure, and support tickets.

---

## Recommendations
- Encourage long-term contracts by offering discounts.
- Improve customer support services.
- Create targeted retention campaigns for at-risk customers.

---

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effective use of machine learning techniques for churn prediction and highlights actionable strategies for telecom companies to enhance customer retention.
